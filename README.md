# Agile
> This project was created using Agile principles via a projectboard on Github. This is the first time I have implemented Agile as an individual developer. However, creating user stories and identifying accepterance criteria acted as a roadmap to target the various features and functionalities of the application. It helped me stay on track and reduced distractions.

# Flow Chart
![Flow Chart](media/TuneTalk%20Flow%20Chart%20(1).png)

During the process of creating the app, I found the flow chart to be an efficient way to make important decisions. It helped me narrow down which decisions were important for both the users and the admin, and it also helped me establish the appropriate authentication. Additionally, the flow chart allowed me to determine which features were the most essential for the app to function properly.
